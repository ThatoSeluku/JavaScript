  [Thanos snaps his fingers, but nothing happens except a metallic "clink." He sees the Infinity Stones are missing. Tony has the stones on his own gauntlet, the gamma radiation coursing through him, to Thanos' shock.]`,
  `THANOS: The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose, beyond temptation`,
  `THANOS: You should be grateful. [Punched by Hulk Buster]`,
  `THANOS: Gone. Reduced to atoms`,
  `THANOS: I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be. [sits himself a little straighter.] I am... inevitable.`,
  `THANOS: Ah, thank you, daughter. [Nebula looks down, a little uncomfortable.] Perhaps I treated you too harshly.

  `THANOS (2014): Ronan's located the Power Stone. I'm dispatching you to his ship.`,
  `THANOS (2014): His alternative is death, then. [Thanos wipes his double-bladed sword] Ronan's obsession clouds his judgement.`,
  `THANOS (2014): No, you won't`,
