When in HTML 
typing eg. 'section.questions' creates a section with the class "questions"
<section class = "questions"></section>

What we're trying to do is show the plus icon when the answer is not shown and as
the answer is revealed, so is the plus icon hidden and replaced with the minus.

How? We tranverse through all the buttons, listen for a click, when clicked we find the
article of the button. aka the parent of the parent. Then, we add the "show-question" query
parent = question-title, parent of parent = article--> question
